r""" The UCBwrong policy for bounded bandits, like UCB but with a typo on the estimator of means:
:math:`\frac{X_k(t)}{t}` is used instead of :math:`\frac{X_k(t)}{N_k(t)}`.

One paper of W.Jouini, C.Moy and J.Palicot from 2009 contained this typo, I reimplemented it just to check that:

- its performance is worse than simple UCB,
- but not that bad...
